        #Define a variable that will receive the input from the user.
        #Define a variable that will receive if the user still willing to play
        #Define a dictionary as a Case Switch operator with the different options and its score. 
        #The left side of the ':', represents the options that we will compare with the inputs from both players.
        #The right side represents the answer we will give as a final score.
        #The sign '-' is used for a better legibility and in order to split later on the string to show which options were took by each player.
        
        #If the user wants to play, we enter the While loop.
        #The variable game is used to store and concatenate the input from user, the '-' sign and the random choice within the three given string options made by the player2/computer
        #This will store something like: 'Rock-Paper'.
        #With this, now we can try to check if this string contained in 'game' exists in the left part of the dictionary. => if game in dct.keys()
        #dct.keys() returns a list contained in the left side of the ':' within the 'dct' => ['Rock-Paper', 'Rock-Scissors',' Paper-Rock' ... ]
          
        #In case such string is in the contained in it (dct.keys())
        #.              => Select the related answer to this keyword 'game', in order to set the final score
        #               => Apply .split() to the string contained in 'game', in order to get the options played by user and computer/player2 
        #               => Print out everythig
        
        #The final variable 'exit' is called again within the while loop to keep the user into the game unless he/she types in 'exit'.
        #The last variable 'plyr', is also called again in order to ask the user for an input.
